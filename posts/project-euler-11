<p><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=11">Problem 11</a> asks:</p>
<blockquote><p>What is the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) in the 20&times;20 grid?</p></blockquote>
<p>I was going to solve this in Java but ended up just using my eyes (with a little help from Vim).</p>
