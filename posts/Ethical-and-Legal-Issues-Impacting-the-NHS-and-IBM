<p>Data security and confidentiality is one of the most crucial issues in the world today. There are cyber-attacks happening constantly, as well as human error causing to leaked information; and companies worldwide are losing millions because of this. Sony pictures are a prime example of how having lacklustre security can cost big time, with Reuters estimating that Sony Pictures could lose up to $100million as a result of this latest attack.<small>(Rickwine, 2014)</small></p>
<p>IBM is one of the market leaders in the IT security industry; so as you would expect, they take their data protection and confidentiality very seriously. “Your privacy is important to IBM; maintaining your trust is paramount to us.”<small>(IBM, 2013)</small></p>
<p>Every day, the company takes steps to ensure client and employee data is secure, as well as their trade secrets. They do this in several ways, but one of the most contentious ways is the banning of Siri, iCloud and DropBox from their employees<small>(Leyden, 2012)</small>. According to Apple’s software license agreement, “When you use Siri or Dictation, the things you say will be recorded and sent to Apple in order to convert what you say into text and, for Siri, to also process your requests.”<small>(Apple Inc, 2013)</small> In addition to this, IBM do not trust that iOS is as secure as it needs to be which is why they require their employees to disable iCloud when accessing internal networks. This shows just how important their confidentiality is.</p>
<p>While IBM are spending a great deal of time and money researching and preventing potential 3rd party risks, the NHS are behind on this. A 3rd party company working for the NHS to run ultrasound scans for the now defunct South Staffordshire Primary Care Trust had been breaking the data protection act in multiple ways. It ranged from storing unencrypted data on unauthorised cloud storage, losing laptops with sensitive raw personal results and communicating results of ultrasounds to NHS via email instead of purpose built secure mediums. While that was 3rd party contractor in the wrong, as dictated by the <small>(DIP, 2007)</small> that checks must be made to ensure that 3rd part companies meet all guidelines. State funded impartial news company BBC, published this information in June 2014 and also referenced that “As many as 10,000 NHS patients may have been affected by a series of data protection breaches.”<small>(Paduano, 2014)</small> Furthermore, the Daily Mail ran an article in February 2014 which headlined “2,000 NHS patients’ records are lost every day…” It mentions several reported instances of personal data leaking out to the general public or being lost, such as “computers containing personal information … sold on eBay.”<small>(Borland, 2014)</small></p>
<p>Generally, the NHS will receive a lot of bad press for their blunders due to the nature of the company. It is mostly state funded the expectations of confidently is high and as it’s a major health provider for 99% of the British public, the subject matter affects everyone. Whereas IBM, are a privately owned business, any mistakes will not be as widely publicised and there will be very little public outcry.</p>
<p>In 2008, IBM spent $1.5billion to increase their data security<small>(Brodkin, 2007)</small>, and we can only speculate as to how much they are spending 6 years later. They offer a range of packages and services for data protection including data vulnerability assessments, data monitoring and audit, data encryption, data redaction and data masking. Despite all this, IBM had the most number of "Distinct” Vulnerabilities in 2014 of the Top 50 IT vendors (450 vulnerabilities) according to <a href="http://www.cvedetails.com/">CVE Details</a>. Compared to other so-called market leaders in the security software market, this is substantially more. Symantec only had 29 vulnerabilities and McAfee were not far behind with 32 vulnerabilities<small>(CVE, 2014)</small>. Now I know that IBM offer more products and services than just security, so the vulnerability per product will be much less, but you need to ask yourself; would your data really be safe with a company who in a single year had almost 500 vulnerabilities in their software.</p>
<p>Even though the NHS appears to be behind the times on their security, a lot of their leaked data isn’t necessarily due to IT errors, but more due to human error. They have several safeguards in place to meet its obligations to maintain the right of confidentiality to persons receiving health care and the practitioners that provide it. As IT isn’t the main focus of the organisation, guidelines that dictate the usage of IT to maintain this are, in our opinion, scattered.</p>
<p>They have “Confidentiality NHS Code of Practice”<small>(NHS England, 2003)</small>, “Guidelines on use of encryption to protect person identifiable and sensitive information”<small>(NHS England, 2011)</small> and “Information Security Management: NHS Code of Practice”<small>(Digital Information Policy, 2007)</small>. While it’s good the NHS have these policies, it’s a shame the lack of the members of staff following these guidelines are lead to the leaking or loss of data.</p>
<p>But there is evidence that some NHS trusts are proactively working to improve their patient confidentiality management.<small>(Kai Winterbottom, 2014)</small>, from the Information Commissioner’s Office, writes about being contacted by Plymouth Hospital NHS Trust and Solent NHS Trust to help “raise awareness of data protection and look at some areas where they’ve had issues in the past”.</p>
<p>After consultation between the ICO and both trusts respectively several changes were implemented. A network of Information Governance (IG) champions, whose duties included being a point of information for staff in that area, over practical ways to avoid information breaches and also perform information security spot checks were bought in. Staff began using key fobs to access shared printers to ensure that sensitive paper based information would not be left unattended<small>(Winterbottom, 2014)</small>, This report supports our view, while the general NHS approach to confidentiality is scattered, it is promising that some NHS trusts are beginning to act and improve on their process management, focusing on problem awareness.</p>
<p>Green IT (or "green computing") is the practice of environmentally sustainable IT. Worldwide, buildings consume 42% of all electricity, more than any other asset. By 2025, buildings are predicted to be the largest emitters of greenhouse gases on Earth.<small>(Sono Motoyama, 2014)</small> Reducing the energy used by buildings is there for crucial in creating a greener world. IBM and the NHS both have strategies in place to lower their carbon footprint by improving their buildings and making them "smarter". NHS is considered to be the “largest public sector contributor to climate change in England”, and IBM is a huge multinational technology and consulting corporation, with a presence in 170 countries. Their sheer size makes green IT critical to their operations, as even small changes to the way they operate can make a huge difference.</p>
<p>IBM has had a long history of energy management innovation, traditionally they optimized individual pieces of equipment in their buildings for maximum energy efficiency, now going forward they are adding a layer of software and analytics technology above the individual system taking a more integrated approach.<small>(SBKarl's channel, 2012)</small> This allows for a reduction in energy use by up to 50%, and increase facilities utilisation by up to 85%. <small>(IBM, 2014)</small> IBM now offers what they have learnt as a solution for their customers to decrease their own footprints. IBM believes their smarter building strategy will provide better tools to manage energy facility, and as a result also reduce the cost. It will also help the environmental goals with their strategy. By the statistics IBM provided, smart building strategy can help organisation reduce 50% of the energy emission and increase energy utilisation by 85%. IBM promises with all these statistics to be a very large contributor in providing smart buildings helping the environment. These smart buildings can also come with some negative side effects which need to be taking into account, such as the security concerns which come with most computer controlled systems. It was reported, "you could turn off the air-conditioning in a data centre, or drop the temperature in an office, or set off the fire alarm, which will unlock all the doors” and later adds on how security facility is “wide open to abuse because their networks are poorly segregated, and they tend to be managed by security with little or no IT background”. These security concerns can be reduced with proper training and security procedures.</p>
<p>IBM topped the list of Newsweek's list of the "greenest" companies in 2012<small>(Coffee, 2012)</small>, and the European Commission awarded IBM the participant status on the Data centre efficiency, it was the largest portfolio of data centres from a single company to receive the recognition to date.<small>(IBM, 2014)</small> Comparatively the NHS is not well known for their green IT, but they are actively taking the steps necessary to lower their carbon footprint.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the NHS is the largest contributor to climate change in the UK, responsible for 3% of the country’s CO2 emissions<small>(Middleton, 2008)</small>. As a result the NHS has produced various reports and plans to cut the energy use and be more efficient. NHS has a vision that will target a low carbon quality healthcare environment. By their statistics, NHS buildings consume over £410 million worth of energy producing 3.7m tons of C02 each year. NHS believes, by a report presented by the Stockholm Environment Institute that 25% of NHS’s current emission can be saved by some simple measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>”Reduced electricity carbon intensity through greater adoption of on-site renewable electricity;</li>
<li>Reduced electricity consumption through lighting, improved controls, standby savers, better product choices;</li>
<li>Increased Combined Heat and Power (CHP) coverage as it avoids the losses from grid-electricity;”</li>
<li>And as a result the NHS plans to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 10% by 2015.<small>(Green Investment Bank, 2014)</small></li>
</ul>
<p>The NHS also has a number of technology interventions that they feel would help reduce energy usage and save money. One of the notable technology is the CHP (Combined heat and power) systems which uses a reciprocating engine or to simultaneously generate both electricity and heat. The waste heat is converted into energy used for heating and cooling. It is believed that CHP technology helps reduce energy costs and also improve environmental performance. The NHS is also taking measures for waste management, where the clinical waste (and heat waste) could be designed to meet the heat and electricity requirements. Also upgrading to LED lights or using other high efficiency lighting can reduce the cost of lights by 50-80% (according to NHS records). There were few more technologies included in this report, such as, HVAC (heating, ventilation and control), building fabric, fuel cells (although is a new technology and not proven in a larger scale in the UK), biomass boilers etc.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the diversity of the facilities and needs, NHS is anticipating that there can be no “one size fits all” financing solution. Instead GIB is offering the “GIB Health Sector Energy Efficiency programme” to NHS where a suite of products will meet with their needs:</p>
<ul>
    <li>“Spend to save: finance repayments are lower than and repaid from cost savings which means there is no need for upfront expenditure by the NHS</li>
    <li>Attractive rates: finance is priced competitively</li>
    <li>Long-term: we can lend for up to 25 years</li>
    <li>Flexible: we can be flexible to meet the project requirements:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>finance can be structured on or off balance sheet,</li>
        <li>repayment profiles set to match project saving expectations.”</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>GIB has their products and also has finance partners supporting them, they are included below:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Direct GIB lending,</li>
    <li>ReALM Energy Centre Fund,</li>
    <li>Generale Equipment Finance alliance,</li>
    <li>Energy Efficiency Funds: SDCL and Equitix.</li>
</ul>
<p>Putting the NHS’s energy efficiency plan and with GIB and Aviva supporting, the Addenbrooke’s hospital estimate spending £36 million alongside Aviva, which will be cost reduction of £6 million each year before repaying interest and capital. With the investment put into practice, it has provided the hospital with the technology that includes Combined Heat & Power (CHP) engine, biomass boilers, efficient dual fuel boilers, and heat recovery from waste incineration. There is reported to be a £1 million saved per annum which will go back into the trust. The technology helps the hospital provide long term energy security and enable to reduce maintenance cost compared to before.</p>
<p>While IBM offers better control to reduce energy consumption it always carries the risk of misuse. NHS’s energy plan may require a lot of support in the beginning but it does guarantee significant energy savings.</p>
