<p><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=17">Problem 17</a> asks:</p>
<blockquote><p>If all the numbers from 1 to 1â€‰000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?</p></blockquote>
<p>This problem can be solved by hand. I essentially used Python as a calculator to solve it:</p>
<pre>
len("onethousand" + 900*"hundred" + 190*"onetwothreefourfivesixseveneightnine" +
    100*"twentythirtyfortyfiftysixtyseventyeightyninety" + 891*"and" +
    10*"teneleventwelvethirteenfourteenfifteensixteenseventeeneighteennineteen")
</pre>
