<p>I will update this posts with quotes I like when I come across them. In no particular order:</p>
<blockquote><p>When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I do my thing and you do your thing.<br />
I am not in this world to live up to your expectations,<br />
And you are not in this world to live up to mine.<br />
You are you, and I am I, and if by chance we find each other, it's beautiful.<br />
If not, it can't be helped.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Once the game is over, the king and the pawn go back in the same box.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much -- the wheel, New York, wars and so on -- whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man -- for precisely the same reasons.</blockquote>
